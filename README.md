# 🦓Zoo Management System

A simple **Java-based zoo management system** built with the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern.  
This project demonstrates a clean architecture with layered structure: **Model**, **DAO**, and **Service**.  
It uses **PostgreSQL** as a database and follows **OOP principles** for separation of concerns.
